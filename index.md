## I don't know about you, but I don't see my friends or family nearly enough.

What are you doing the last week of July, 2021? So this beach house idea is just an effort to 
get just a little more friends and family into our lives.

Nags Head is the center of the action in the Outer Banks (OBX). So the plan is to rent a 
beach house there. If there is a lot of interest we can rent a bigger house or perhaps even 
more than one house.

Well I would love for you to join me in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, a place I have 
visited and loved many a summer.

If you are unfamiliar with the amazing Outer Banks, you can find more information 
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Banks).
